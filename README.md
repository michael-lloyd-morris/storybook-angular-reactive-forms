# Chapter One: Setup

To get started you'll need the following setup

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/) - The tutorial was built in version 22.
* [Angular Cli](https://angular.dev/tools/cli)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) extension is recommended but not required.

So lets run some shell commands. In the directory you want to store your coding projects create the Angular project itself

```bash
$ ng new my-project
```
