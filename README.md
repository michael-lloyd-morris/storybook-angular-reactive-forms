# Storybook Testing of Angular Reactive Forms
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a frontend workshop for building UI components following the principles of [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) as set forth by Brad Frost. It was original built for use with the React Framework but has since been expanded to support Angular. The documentation of how to test components that use Event Emitters and [Reactive Forms](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/reactive-forms) to share data with the rest of the application has been lacking. This tutorial sets out to correct this problem.

Each branch of this git repository holds the state of the code base after the instructions described in the README file of that branch have been completed.
